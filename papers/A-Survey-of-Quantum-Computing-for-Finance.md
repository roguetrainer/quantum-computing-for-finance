### Overview

This comprehensive survey paper examines the state of quantum computing applications in finance, arguing that finance is estimated to be the first industry sector to benefit from quantum computing in the short, medium, and long terms.

### Main Topics Covered

The survey emphasizes three primary areas where quantum computing can impact financial applications:

1. **Stochastic Modeling and Monte Carlo Integration**
   - The paper discusses how quantum solutions can help solve derivative pricing and risk analysis problems more efficiently and accurately through Monte Carlo methods

2. **Optimization**
   - Portfolio optimization is identified as a key application area where quantum algorithms can potentially provide advantages

3. **Machine Learning**
   - The survey covers quantum machine learning applications including natural language processing and fraud detection in financial contexts

### Structure and Content

The paper is organized into several sections covering: the applicability of quantum computing to finance, macroeconomic challenges for financial institutions, financial use cases for quantum computing (including numerical risk modeling, optimization, and machine learning), and fundamental concepts of quantum computing

The authors discuss various models of quantum computation, including gate-based quantum computing, and examine different hardware implementations

### Near-Term Feasibility

A significant portion of the paper is dedicated to discussing the feasibility of quantum algorithms on near-term quantum computers (NISQ devices) with various hardware implementations, demonstrating how these algorithms relate to practical use cases in finance

The survey acknowledges that current quantum computers are small-scale and noisy, but expresses hope that useful applications can still be found for them

### Hardware Platforms

The paper discusses the diversity of potential hardware platforms for quantum computation, noting that proposals exist based on vastly different physical systems including superconductors, trapped ions, neutral atoms, and photons, though no clear winner has emerged

### Quantum Advantage and Speedups

The authors explain that while quantum computers may theoretically reduce computation time and memory requirements, obtaining quantum speedup requires developing new algorithms that specifically leverage quantum-mechanical properties, and the speedup for each task can vary greatly or may be currently unknown

### Integration with Classical Computing

The paper emphasizes that classical and quantum computers will need to work together, as any classical algorithm can be modified to run on a quantum computer (though without automatic speedup), and classical computers must efficiently insert and obtain data from quantum computers

### Purpose and Audience

The authors state their hope that the article will serve as a reference for both academic researchers and industry practitioners while inspiring new ideas for future research

### Significance

This survey has become an influential reference in the quantum finance community, being cited in subsequent Nature Reviews Physics articles and other major publications on quantum computing for finance. It provides a comprehensive bridge between quantum computing concepts and practical financial applications, making it valuable for both physicists entering the finance domain and financial professionals exploring quantum technologies.
